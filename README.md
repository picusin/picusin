- 👋 Hi, I’m Miguel.
- 👀 I'm an architect currently training and educating myself to become a data scientist.
- 🌱 After a couple courses focusing on SQL, Python and data analysis, I'm now starting with the basics of machine learning.
- 💞️ I'd love to collaborate with other data analysts and scientists to put this learning into practice.
- 🤝 Here you'll find some of my projects to give you an idea of what I'm capable of. I'd be happy to hear what you think!
- 📫 You can contact me through my LinkedIn account, you'll find the link on my profile.
